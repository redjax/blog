Welcome to Techobyte, a personal blog about technology. This blog covers varied topics with no posting cadence or central theme. The blog's content is text-heavy, although some articles may use images to enhance or clarify things.

I write about tools I use and projects I work on in my homelab, and share the knowledge on this blog. In my free time I like to try new technologies and tools, and I love to share that knowledge with others. I hope the hours I spend struggling on certain things and choose to write about can get you over a hump.

You can subscribe to the [RSS feed](/index.xml), a feed of the entire site. Add `/index.xml` to individual pages/sections on the site to subscribe to content of that type. For example, check the [`posts` feed](/posts/index.xml) to see a feed of only the [posts](/posts/) made on this site (no [notes](/notes/) or [code snippets](/notes/snippets/)). Or if you *only* want to see snippets, subscribe to [`notes/snippets/index.xml`](/notes/snippets/index.xml).
